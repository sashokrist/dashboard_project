Project Description:

Dynamic Link Dashboard with Configurable Buttons

Overview

The Dynamic Link Dashboard is a web application designed to manage and configure a set of customizable buttons, each with unique links, titles, and colors. Built with Laravel, this application provides users with a streamlined interface to create, edit, delete, and organize interactive buttons for quick access to specified URLs.

Key Features

Dashboard Interface:

The main dashboard displays a grid of user-configurable buttons.
Each button includes a title, a color, and an optional URL link.
Users can easily see all available buttons and click to open URLs directly.

Configurable Button Modal:

Buttons marked "Config" open an inline modal where users can edit button details.
The modal allows users to update the buttonâ€™s title, link, and color without leaving the dashboard.
AJAX is used for seamless, page-refresh-free updates.

Button Management:

Create New Button-
Users can add a new button to the dashboard with a default title, link, and color.
Edit Button: Through the modal, users can modify button properties. This includes adding a new URL link or changing the title and color.
Delete Button: Users can delete a button, permanently removing it from the dashboard.
User-Specific Access:

Only authenticated users have access to the dashboard.
Each user sees and manages only their own buttons.
Technical Highlights

Frontend:

The user interface is built with Bootstrap, providing a responsive, mobile-friendly design.

AJAX Integration:

AJAX is implemented for modal-based editing, creating a smoother, dynamic experience without full-page reloads.
Laravel Backend:

Built with Laravel, the backend manages user authentication, and button data storage.

Database:

The button configuration is stored in a relational database, including user ownership details for secure, user-specific access.
